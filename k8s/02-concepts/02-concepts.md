The Concepts section helps you learn about the parts of the Kubernetes system and the abstractions Kubernetes uses to represent your cluster, and helps you obtain a deeper understanding of how Kubernetes works.

概念部分帮助你了解 Kubernetes 系统的各个部分以及 Kubernetes 用来表示集群的抽象概念， 并帮助你更深入地理解 Kubernetes 是如何工作的。

**Overview**

Kubernetes is a portable, extensible, open source platform for managing containerized workloads and services, that facilitates both declarative configuration and automation. It has a large, rapidly growing ecosystem. Kubernetes services, support, and tools are widely available.

**Cluster Architecture**

The architectural concepts behind Kubernetes.

**Containers**

Technology for packaging an application along with its runtime dependencies.

**Windows in Kubernetes**

**Workloads**

Understand Pods, the smallest deployable compute object in Kubernetes, and the higher-level abstractions that help you to run them.

**Services, Load Balancing, and Networking**

Concepts and resources behind networking in Kubernetes.

**Storage**

Ways to provide both long-term and temporary storage to Pods in your cluster.

**Configuration**

Resources that Kubernetes provides for configuring Pods.

**Security**

Concepts for keeping your cloud-native workload secure.

**Policies**

Policies you can configure that apply to groups of resources.

**Scheduling, Preemption and Eviction**

In Kubernetes, scheduling refers to making sure that Pods are matched to Nodes so that the kubelet can run them. Preemption is the process of terminating Pods with lower Priority so that Pods with higher Priority can schedule on Nodes. Eviction is the process of proactively terminating one or more Pods on resource-starved Nodes.

**Cluster Administration**

Lower-level detail relevant to creating or administering a Kubernetes cluster.

**Extending Kubernetes**

Different ways to change the behavior of your Kubernetes cluster.
