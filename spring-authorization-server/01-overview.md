# Introducing Spring Authorization Server

Spring Authorization Server is a framework that provides implementations of the `OAuth 2.1` and `OpenID Connect 1.0` specifications and other related specifications. 

It is built on top of `Spring Security` to provide a secure, light-weight, and customizable foundation for building OpenID Connect 1.0 Identity Providers and OAuth2 Authorization Server products.
