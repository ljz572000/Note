# Preface

The Spring Data Elasticsearch project applies core Spring concepts to the development of solutions using the Elasticsearch Search Engine.

Spring Data Elasticsearch项目将Spring的核心概念应用到Elasticsearch搜索引擎的解决方案开发中。

It provides:

- Templates as a high-level abstraction for storing, searching, sorting documents and building aggregations.
- 模板作为存储、搜索、排序文档和构建聚合的高级抽象。
- Repositories which for example enable the user to express queries by defining interfaces having customized method names (for basic information about repositories see Working with Spring Data Repositories).
- 例如，允许用户通过定义具有自定义方法名的接口来表达查询的存储库(有关存储库的基本信息，请参阅使用Spring数据存储库)。

You will notice similarities to the Spring data solr and mongodb support in the Spring Framework.
